LONGER-TERM STUFF:

- Add a += operator, so that additional elements can be appended to a list or
  array

- Add support for #include's; a patch was submitted for this previously, but it
  is not reentrant (uses static global variables), so can't be used as-is. I
  just haven't gotten around to implementing this because it's not a trivial
  change, and free time being in limited supply as it is...

- Add limited support for preserving comments?

- Add support for unicode strings? A bit problematic, since flex doesn't
  support unicode input, AFAICT. But maybe a way to convert between
  parsed UTF-8 strings and std::wstring.
