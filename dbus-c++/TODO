* Implement asynchronous method calls (hint: start from DBus::PendingCall)
* ...and patch the codegen to generate stubs for them
* Implement continuations in a saner way
* Find time for some hardcore valgrinding
* Make DBus::Server free an incoming connection when it's disconnected, not when freeing the server
* More examples
* Inline (Doxygen-style) documentation
* Native protocol implementation (as an alternative to libdbus)
