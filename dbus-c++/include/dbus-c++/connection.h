	 * \brief Adds a match rule to match messages going through the message bus.
	 *
	 * The "rule" argument is the string form of a match rule.
	 *
	 * If you pass NULL for the error, this function will not block; the match 
	 * thus won't be added until you flush the connection, and if there's an error 
	 * adding the match (only possible error is lack of resources in the bus), you
	 * won't find out about it.
	 *
	 * Normal API conventions would have the function return a boolean value 
	 * indicating whether the error was set, but that would require blocking always 
	 * to determine the return value.
	 *
	 * The AddMatch method is fully documented in the D-Bus specification. For 
	 * quick reference, the format of the match rules is discussed here, but the 
	 * specification is the canonical version of this information.
	 *
	 * Rules are specified as a string of comma separated key/value pairs. An 
	 * example is "type='signal',sender='org.freedesktop.DBus', 
	 * interface='org.freedesktop.DBus',member='Foo', path='/bar/foo',destination=':452345.34'"
	 *
	 * Possible keys you can match on are type, sender, interface, member, path, 
	 * destination and numbered keys to match message args (keys are 'arg0', 'arg1', etc.). 
	 * Omitting a key from the rule indicates a wildcard match. For instance omitting 
	 * the member from a match rule but adding a sender would let all messages from
	 * that sender through regardless of the member.
	 *
	 * Matches are inclusive not exclusive so as long as one rule matches the
	 * message will get through. It is important to note this because every time a
	 * essage is received the application will be paged into memory to process it.
	 * This can cause performance problems such as draining batteries on embedded platforms.
	 *
	 * If you match message args ('arg0', 'arg1', and so forth) only string arguments 
	 * will match. That is, arg0='5' means match the string "5" not the integer 5.
	 *
	 * Currently there is no way to match against non-string arguments.
	 *
	 * Matching on interface is tricky because method call messages only optionally
	 * specify the interface. If a message omits the interface, then it will NOT
	 * match if the rule specifies an interface name. This means match rules on 
	 * method calls should not usually give an interface.
	 *
	 * However, signal messages are required to include the interface so when 
	 * matching signals usually you should specify the interface in the match rule.
	 *
	 * For security reasons, you can match arguments only up to DBUS_MAXIMUM_MATCH_RULE_ARG_NUMBER.
	 *
	 * Match rules have a maximum length of DBUS_MAXIMUM_MATCH_RULE_LENGTH bytes.
	 *
	 * Both of these maximums are much higher than you're likely to need, they only 
	 * exist because the D-Bus bus daemon has fixed limits on all resource usage.
	 *
	 * \param rule Textual form of match rule.

	 * The only reason to use this function is to re-implement the equivalent of

	 * This function will block until registration is complete.
	 *

	 * manually is only useful if you have your own custom message bus not found 
	 * in DBusBusType.
	 *
	 * If you open a bus connection by the contructor of Connection() you will have to register_bus() 
	 * yourself, or make the appropriate registration method calls yourself. If
